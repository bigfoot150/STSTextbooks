To be able to use some of the website, you are going to have to know your MySQL username/password and make a connection to our database. Since we don't have a dedicated database server, we rely on you to supply your own credentials and create the schema in your own database. 

To do this open MySQL Workbench:
Create a schema: ststb
Grab your username/password from mysql

inject the username/password wherever it is needed inside the project in the hibernate.xml.config or any of the jsp pages that query the database.
