    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>Do I have to be a student to use the web site?
        <dd>
            No. Anyone can use the web site to sell and buy books.
        </dd>
        <dt>Do I have to sell "text books" or, can I sell any type of book?
        <dd>
            You can sell any type of book on the web site. However, the web site was
            created with text books as the main category therefore, you will find more buyers and
            sellers of these types of books.
        </dd>
        <dt>Can I buy or ship internationally?
        <dd>

        </dd>
        <dt>What is your policy regarding web cookies?
        <dd>
            The web site uses cookies to track the search and buying history  of a user so that more relevant
            titles which are available in the database are presented to the user in the side bar. Your
            cookies are not shared with any third parties.
        </dd>
        <dt>The book that I received was in much worse condition than advertised. What should I do?
        <dd>
            Reach out to the buyer via e-mail and present them with pictures of the book you received
            and a copy of the condition statement they made about the book on their sell page. Ask them
            for a partial refund because of the large discrepancy.
        </dd>
        <dt>How do I calculate a shipping cost?
        <dd>
            An exact shipping cost will require knowing the buyers ship to address which, is not available
            when you list your item for sale. <br>
            You therefore have two choices. <br>
            First. Estimate the shipping cost using the USPS calculator found here.
            <a href="https://postcalc.usps.com/Calculator/ShapeAndSize?country=0&ccode=US&oz=33139&omil=False&dz=46614&dmil=False&mdt=11%2F25%2F2019&mdz=11%3A59&m=0" 
               target ="_blank"  title="usps shipping calculator">USPS shipping calculator</a>
            , and inform the buyer on your sell page that this is only an estimate. 
            Base the shipping cost estimate on a location far from your current ship from location to be conservative.
            The same principle can be applied with USPS or FedEx shipping estimates.<br>
            Second. Estimate the shipping cost and inform the buyer on your sell page that you will pay shipping costs up 
            to a certain dollar amount. Once the actual amount is calculated, any difference, is the responsibility of the buyer.

            low cost.

        </dd>
        <dt>Why doesn&apos;t the web site have an integrated shipping system?
        <dd>
            The web site wasn&apos;t designed with high-volume commercial users in mind. It was designed to 
            keep buying and selling transactions costs low for students who already spend a lot of money on books.
