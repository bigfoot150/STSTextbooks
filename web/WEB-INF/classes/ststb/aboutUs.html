        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>StudentToStudentTextBooks.com</strong> was created by Nikolas Lennon, Nicholas Sobczak, and Jason Taylor
            as a group project for COP4813 Web Applications Programming at Florida State University.<br><br>
            
            The web site was designed with the goal of providing low and transparent transaction costs
            when buying and selling previously used textbooks that are required for college courses.<br><br>
           
            The low transaction costs will allow the seller to get more money for selling their book once they 
            are finished using it for the semester, while at the same time allowing the buyer to pay less.<br><br>
            
            This is possible because such a low fee is charged for each transaction thus,
            the seller doesn&apos;t need to raise prices on the buyer to offset high transaction costs.
            The buyer and seller share in the transaction costs equally.<br><br>
            
            The transparency will give both the buyer and seller confidence that the middleman,
            StudentToStudentTextbooks.com, isn&apos;t gouging users for its own benefit.
