            I purchased a book but have not received it. What should I do?
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Contact the seller and request the shipping date. Shipping methods like USPS Media Mailk
        while inexpensive, are slow. Deliver time can take many days to a couple week. Therefore,
        confirm that the expected arrival date has indeed passed.

        <strong>   
            It has been weeks since I purchased a book and I still have not received it. The
            seller is not communicating with me or, refuses to refund my purchase. What can I do?

    <p>
        Contact Paypal or your credit card company and ask them to refund your money and/or
            reverse the transaction.
