    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Do I have to be a student to use the web site?</strong>
            <br><br>
            No. Anyone can use the web site to sell and buy books.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Do I have to sell "text books" or, can I sell any type of book?</strong>
            <br><br>
            You can sell any type of book on the web site. However, the web site was
            created with text books as the main category therefore, you will find more buyers and
            sellers of those types of books.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Can I buy or ship internationally?</strong>
         <br><br>
            At this time the web site is setup only for continental USA transaction.
            <br><br>
            <strong>What is your policy regarding web cookies?</strong>
         <br><br>
            The web site uses cookies to track the search and buying history  of a user so that more relevant
            book titles which are available in the our database are presented to the user in the side bar. The 
            cookies are not shared with any third parties.
         <br><br>
         <strong>The book that I received was in much worse condition than advertised. What should I do?</strong>
         <br><br>
            Reach out to the buyer via e-mail and present them with pictures of the book you received
            and a copy of the condition statement they made about the book on their sell page. Ask them
            for a partial refund because of the large discrepancy.
         <br><br>
         <strong>How do I calculate a shipping cost?</strong>
         <br><br>
            An exact shipping cost will require knowing the buyers ship to address which, is not available
            when you list your item for sale. <br><br>
            Two solutions for overcoming this fact are: <br><br>
            First. Estimate the shipping cost using the USPS calculator found here.
            <a href="https://postcalc.usps.com/Calculator/ShapeAndSize?country=0&ccode=US&oz=33139&omil=False&dz=46614&dmil=False&mdt=11%2F25%2F2019&mdz=11%3A59&m=0" 
               target ="_blank"  title="usps shipping calculator">USPS shipping calculator</a>
            , and inform the buyer on your sell page that this is only an estimate. 
            Base the shipping cost estimate on a location far from your current ship from location to be conservative.
            The same principle can be applied with USPS or FedEx shipping estimates.<br><br>
            Second. Estimate the shipping cost and inform the buyer on your sell page that you will pay shipping costs up 
            to a certain dollar amount. Once the actual amount is calculated, any difference, is the responsibility of the buyer.
         <br><br>
         <strong>What shipping methods are available?</strong>
         <br><br>
            The most common shipping methods are USPS, FedEx, and UPS. We recommend USPS Media Mail because of its
            low cost. 
         <a href="https://www.ups.com/us/en/Home.page" target="_blank" title="ups home page">UPS</a> 
         <a href="https://www.fedex.com/en-us/home.html" target="_blank" title="FedEx home page">FedEx</a> 
          <a href="https://www.usps.com/" target ="_blank"  title="usps shipping calculator">USPS</a>
         <br><br>

                                                                      target="_blank" title="usps eligibility requirements">usps eligibility</a>
            <br><br>

            Enter the weight in pounds and ounces then click either "Large Envelop" or "Package" to continue.
         <br><br>
         <strong>Why doesn&apos;t the web site have an integrated shipping system?</strong>
         <br><br>
            The web site wasn&apos;t designed with high-volume commercial users in mind. It was designed to 
            keep buying and selling transactions costs low for students who already spend a lot of money on books.
         <br><br>
         <strong>
            I purchased a book but have not received it. What should I do?
        </strong>
         <br><br>
            Contact the seller and request the shipping date. Shipping methods like USPS Media Mail
            while inexpensive, are slow. Deliver time can take many days to a couple week. Therefore,
            confirm that the expected arrival date has indeed passed.
         <br><br>
         <strong>   
            It has been weeks since I purchased a book and I still have not received it. The
            seller is not communicating with me or, refuses to refund my purchase. What can I do?
         </strong>
         <br><br>
            Contact Paypal or your credit card company and file a claim to dispute the charges and/or
            reverse the transaction. Also, please file a report with us and we will flag that account. If
            others users have problems with that particular account, we will remove them from our site.
